## Abstract

C++ has bytes. A contiguous region of bytes needs a type. A sequence of such regions needs another. This paper examines the types that predictably come to mind, and their consequences.

## 1. Disclosure

The author provides information and serves at the pleasure of the committee.

The author maintains [Boost.Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast)<sup>[1]</sup>, a published HTTP and WebSocket library built on [Boost.Asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/boost_asio.html)<sup>[2]</sup>'s buffer model, and develops [Capy, Corosio, Http, Beast2, and Burl](https://github.com/cppalliance)<sup>[3]</sup> - libraries that define or consume buffer abstractions. The author published [P4003R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4003r0.pdf)<sup>[4]</sup>. The author holds a neutral position on the Networking TS (changed from positive). This body of work creates a bias toward dedicated buffer types. Such types have costs: one more vocabulary type to learn, and interoperability friction with code that uses raw `span<byte>`.

This paper asks for nothing.

## 2. Credit Where Due

`std::span` is a well-established vocabulary type. It turns a pointer and a size into a single thing. Perfectly. The vocabulary need is profound and this paper does not propose to diminish it.

The question is whether `span` is also the right vocabulary for I/O buffer descriptors.

## 3. `span<byte>`

Question. How do we represent a contiguous region of bytes?

Answer. `span<byte>`. A pointer and a size. That works.

However...

Platform I/O requires an array, not one region:

| Platform | Descriptor      | Used By                                            |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| POSIX    | `struct iovec`  | `readv()` / `writev()`                             |
| POSIX    | `struct msghdr` | `sendmsg()` / `recvmsg()`                         |
| Windows  | `WSABUF`        | `WSARecv()` / `WSASend()`                          |
| Windows  | `FILE_SEGMENT_ELEMENT` | `ReadFileScatter()` / `WriteFileGather()`   |
| Linux    | `struct iovec`  | `io_uring_prep_readv()` / `io_uring_prep_writev()` |

`span<byte>` can describe one region. Wrap it in a one-element array and `readv()` accepts it. But I/O rarely involves a single contiguous region. A message has a header and a body. A protocol has framing and payload. Sending two regions with `write()` means two syscalls. Sending them with `writev()` means one - this is scatter/gather I/O. `span<byte>` is an insufficient type for representing an array of buffers.

## 4. `span<span<byte>>`

Question. How do we represent several such regions?

Answer. A span of spans. `span<span<byte>>`.

A single buffer is a view of someone's data. The bytes exist somewhere - in a `vector`, in a memory-mapped page, in a stack array. The buffer borrows them. Non-owning is natural. The data has a natural owner elsewhere.

A buffer sequence is different. Nobody "naturally" has an array of `span<byte>` objects lying around. The sequence is an assembled grouping - a data structure constructed to collect regions together. Making it non-owning means the grouping itself cannot be stored, returned, or passed across an asynchronous boundary.

```cpp
class message {
    span<span<byte>> buffers_; // borrows... what?
};

span<span<byte>> prepare_message(span<byte> hdr, span<byte> body) {
    span<byte> bufs[] = { hdr, body };
    return { bufs }; // dangling
}

void start_send(socket& s, span<byte> hdr, span<byte> body) {
    span<byte> bufs[] = { hdr, body };
    s.async_send(span<span<byte>>(bufs), callback);
    // returns immediately; bufs destroyed; dangling
}
```

## 5. `range<span<byte>>`

Question. How do we own a collection of byte regions?

Answer. Use a range. `vector<span<byte>>`, `array<span<byte>, N>`, any range whose value type is `span<byte>`.

Ranges solve the ownership problem: a `vector` owns its elements.

Ranges create a byte consumption problem. Consider a JSON stream arriving in two chunks:

```cpp
// chunk 1 [100 bytes]: {"name":"Alice","age":30}{"name":"B
// chunk 2 [100 bytes]: ob","age":25}...

range<span<byte>> input = { chunk1, chunk2 };

// parser finds first complete object: {"name":"Alice","age":30}
// that is 26 bytes - consume them
//
// views::drop(input, 1) drops all of chunk1 (100 bytes) - too much
// views::drop(input, 0) drops nothing - too little
// no standard range operation removes exactly 26 bytes
```

The parse boundary (26 bytes) does not align with the buffer boundary (100 bytes). Consuming 26 bytes means advancing chunk 1 by 26 bytes - 74 remain - without touching chunk 2. No range adaptor does this. [`std::ranges`](https://eel.is/c++draft/ranges)<sup>[5]</sup> operates on elements. Parsing operates on bytes, not elements.

Incremental parsers with this need - JSON, XML, CSV, protobuf - go unserved.

## 6. `byte`

Question. What if we add byte-level algorithms to a range of `span<byte>`?

Answer. The range is fine for ownership and iteration. The element type is not.

`span<byte>` already serves too many needs: serialization, cryptography, hashing, memory-mapped regions. If buffer sequences also use `span<byte>`, the type system cannot distinguish a buffer from any other byte span. A concept, an overload, or a constraint that separates "buffer in a sequence" from "hash input" or "encryption key" is impossible to write.

### Boost.Asio

A separate type enables run-time safety checks:

| Capability                         | Asio `mutable_buffer`<sup>[2]</sup>  | `span<byte>` |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Implementation-defined members     | Possible                             | Closed       |
| Detect dangling after reallocation | Possible                             | No           |
| Future diagnostic aids             | Possible                             | No           |
| Conditional debug callback         | `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_BUFFER_DEBUGGING` | No           |

Each time `span<byte>` appears in a function signature, it loses the safety capability.

## 7. Six Ecosystems Already Arrived Here

Six I/O ecosystems, designed independently, all arrived at similar solutions:

| Ecosystem | Buffer Type                       | Layout                                                          |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POSIX     | `iovec`                           | `void*` + `size_t`                                              |
| Windows   | `WSABUF`                          | `ULONG` + `char*`                                               |
| Asio      | `const_buffer` / `mutable_buffer` | `void const*` + `size_t`, with range concepts<sup>[2]</sup>     |
| libuv     | `uv_buf_t`                        | `char*` + `size_t`<sup>[6]</sup>                                |
| Go        | `net.Buffers`                     | scatter/gather over `[][]byte`<sup>[7]</sup>                    |
| .NET      | `ReadOnlySequence<T>`             | linked list of discontiguous `Memory<T>` segments<sup>[8]</sup> |

Everybody converged on custom types independently.

## 8. The Final Straw

The committee already endorsed this principle.

[P0298R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0298r3.pdf)<sup>[9]</sup> introduced `std::byte` because `unsigned char` performed triple duty. Neil MacIntosh wrote:

> "these types perform a 'triple duty'. Not only are they used for byte addressing, but also as arithmetic types, and as character types. This multiplicity of roles opens the door for programmer error"<sup>[9]</sup>

> "The key motivation here is to make byte a distinct type - to improve program safety by leveraging the type system."<sup>[9]</sup>

`unsigned char` had the right size and alignment. The committee added `std::byte` anyway - same size, same alignment, but no arithmetic, no implicit conversions. The generic type's operations did not match the domain. The committee restricted the interface.

`span<byte>` performs double duty - general-purpose byte view and I/O buffer descriptor. A bespoke type restricts the interface to `data()` and `size()`. Same principle, one level of abstraction higher.

**The precise fit is bespoke.**

### Almost There

`std::byte` kept the shift operators despite the stated goal of removing arithmetic. The principle was right. The execution left a gap.

## 9. Finally Correct

New buffer types give us the principled option. Only what we need: `data()` and `size()`.

### `void*`, Not `byte*`

`void*` is maximally accepting and minimally permissive. Any pointer converts to it implicitly. The user must perform an explicit cast to go back. The asymmetry is by design.

| Risk                        | `void*` | `byte*` | Cost                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Requires `reinterpret_cast` | No      | Yes     | Invites superfluous casts                  |
| Dereferenceable             | No      | Yes     | Invites accidental access                  |
| Pointer arithmetic          | No      | Yes     | Invites accidental arithmetic              |
| Assignable to `span<byte>`  | No      | Yes     | Invites full span API misuse               |
| Promises byte-level meaning | No      | Yes     | Invites false type assertions              |
| Contradicts type erasure    | No      | Yes     | Invites type erasure violations            |
| C++17 only                  | No      | Yes     | Disinvites C users                         |

### A Buffer Sequence Is Distinct

Buffer sequences are not served by existing concepts. They are a new concept.

### What the Standard Needs

- A read-only byte region type (`void const*` + `size_t`)
- A writable byte region type (`void*` + `size_t`)
- Concepts for sequences of read-only and writable byte regions
- Algorithms: total byte count, byte-granular slicing, copy between buffer sequences

The types already exist:

```cpp
class mutable_buffer {
    unsigned char* p_ = nullptr;
    std::size_t n_ = 0;
public:
    mutable_buffer() = default;
    mutable_buffer(mutable_buffer const&) = default;
    mutable_buffer& operator=(mutable_buffer const&) = default;
    constexpr mutable_buffer(void* data, std::size_t size) noexcept
        : p_(static_cast<unsigned char*>(data)), n_(size) { }
    constexpr void* data() const noexcept { return p_; }
    constexpr std::size_t size() const noexcept { return n_; }
};

class const_buffer {
    unsigned char const* p_ = nullptr;
    std::size_t n_ = 0;
public:
    const_buffer() = default;
    const_buffer(const_buffer const&) = default;
    const_buffer& operator=(const_buffer const& other) = default;
    constexpr const_buffer(void const* data, std::size_t size) noexcept
        : p_(static_cast<unsigned char const*>(data)), n_(size) { }
    constexpr const_buffer(mutable_buffer const& b) noexcept
        : p_(static_cast<unsigned char const*>(b.data())), n_(b.size()) { }
    constexpr void const* data() const noexcept { return p_; }
    constexpr std::size_t size() const noexcept { return n_; }
};
```

These are the [Networking TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/n4771.pdf)<sup>[10]</sup> types.

## 10. Side by Side

| Task                  | `span<byte>`                                         | `mutable_buffer`                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Construct from vector | `span<byte>{reinterpret_cast<byte*>(v.data()), ...}` | `mutable_buffer{v.data(), v.size()}` |
| Consume N bytes       | `buf = span<byte>{buf.data() + n, buf.size() - n}`   | `buf += n`                           |
| Detect dangling       | Requires ABI Break                                   | *see-below*                          |

Safety feature:

```cpp
class mutable_buffer {
    void* p_ = nullptr;
    size_t n_ = 0;
    void(*check_)() = nullptr;
public:
    void* data() const { if(check_) check_(); return p_; }
    size_t size() const noexcept { return n_; }
};
```

Smaller to write, safer to use, open to diagnostics.

## 11. But

### But this is standardizing Asio's types

Yes. They earn their keep.

### But `vector<span<byte>>` is enough

Users opt out of types which do not let them opt out of allocations.

### But `mdspan` is enough

Buffer sequences only need one dimension. [`mdspan`](https://eel.is/c++draft/mdspan.overview)<sup>[5]</sup> provides several.

### But `span<void>` is enough

Even if `span<void>` were possible, what remains after removing the impossible is `data()` and `size()`. That is just a less-capable `mutable_buffer`.

### But `span<byte>` is enough

`span<byte>` is also a less-capable `mutable_buffer`. It is `span<void>` with added harm. 

## Suggested Straw Poll

> LEWG agrees that a contiguous byte region descriptor for I/O should be a dedicated type, not `span<byte>`.
